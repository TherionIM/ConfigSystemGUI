# ConfigSystemGUI
Configuration system GUI

The purpose of this tool is to provide a useful and dynamic graphical interface on top of a simple config file. The resultant config file can be used by other tools/applications to perform their tasks. For example if you have an application that performs some analysis based on a number of parameters defined in a config file and would like non programers to use it you can wrap the configuration setup with a graphical user interface using this tool. The end goal is to destribute your application with this tool and a GUI xml setup so that users can use your application directly via the GUI. 

Please take a look at ui.xml on how to setup the config system UI.

Use: ConfigSystemUI.jar "xml_ui_specification_file".xml
